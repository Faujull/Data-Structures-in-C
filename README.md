# 📚 Data Structures in C  

This repository contains **C implementations** of various **data structures and algorithms** that I learned in my **Data Structures course**, taught by **Md. Habibullah Belali**. These programs cover fundamental concepts like arrays, stacks, queues, searching, sorting, and expression conversion.  

## 📖 Topics Covered  

### 🔹 **Arrays**  
- 📂 `array_insertion.c` – Insert an element into an array  
- 📂 `array_deletion.c` – Delete an element from an array  

### 🔹 **Stack**  
- 📂 `stack.c` – Stack implementation  
- 📂 `stack-infix-to-postfix.c` – Convert infix expression to postfix  
- 📂 `stack-parenthesis.c` – Parenthesis matching using stack  

### 🔹 **Queue**  
- 📂 `linear_queue.c` – Linear queue implementation  
- 📂 `circular_queue.c` – Circular queue implementation  
- 📂 `priority_queue.c` – Priority queue implementation  

### 🔹 **Sorting Algorithms**  
- 📂 `bubble_sort.c` – Bubble Sort  
- 📂 `selection_sort.c` – Selection Sort  
- 📂 `insertion_sort.c` – Insertion Sort  

### 🔹 **Searching Algorithms**  
- 📂 `linear_search.c` – Linear Search  
- 📂 `binary_search.c` – Binary Search  

## 🛠️ Programming Language  
**C (Standard C99)**  

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository  
📌 To store and review code learned in class  
📌 To practice and improve problem-solving skills  
📌 To help others understand data structures in C  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This repository contains **educational code** from my coursework. Please use it for **learning purposes only** and do not submit it as your own work in academic settings.
