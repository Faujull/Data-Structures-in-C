📚 Data Structures in C
This repository contains C implementations of various data structures and algorithms that I learned in my Data Structures course. The code is based on lessons taught by Md. Habibullah Belali and serves as a reference for further learning and practice.

📖 Topics Covered
🔹 Arrays
📂 array_insertion.c – Insert an element into an array

📂 array_deletion.c – Delete an element from an array

🔹 Stack
📂 stack.c – Stack implementation

📂 stack-infix-to-postfix.c – Convert infix expression to postfix

📂 stack-parenthesis.c – Parenthesis matching using stack

🔹 Queue
📂 linear_queue.c – Linear queue implementation

📂 circular_queue.c – Circular queue implementation

📂 priority_queue.c – Priority queue implementation

🔹 Sorting Algorithms
📂 bubble_sort.c – Bubble Sort

📂 selection_sort.c – Selection Sort

📂 insertion_sort.c – Insertion Sort

🔹 Searching Algorithms
📂 linear_search.c – Linear Search

📂 binary_search.c – Binary Search

🛠️ Programming Language
C (Standard C99)

🚀 Purpose of This Repository
📌 To store and review code learned in class
📌 To practice and improve problem-solving skills
📌 To help others understand data structures in C
